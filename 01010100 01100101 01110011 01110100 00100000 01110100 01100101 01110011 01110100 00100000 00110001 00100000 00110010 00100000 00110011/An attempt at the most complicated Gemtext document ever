## Introduction

Gemtext is a simple, text-based markup language used by the Gemini protocol. It supports only a handful of elements:
* Headings (up to three levels)
* Unordered lists
* Dedicated link lines
* Block quotes
* Preformatted text blocks

This page demonstrates all available features in one document.

## Features of Gemtext

Gemtext provides:
* **Headings:** Indicate hierarchy using `#`, `##`, or `###`.
* **Lists:** Create bullet lists with `*`.
* **Links:** Write a link on its own line using `=>`.
* **Quotes:** Use `>` to designate block quotes.
* **Preformatted Blocks:** Enclose text in triple backticks (```) for code, ASCII art, or any verbatim text.

_ \ / ` | | | |/ _ \ / _ \ / __|
) | (| | || | // ___ \ 
|/ _,|_, |_/_/ __/
|___/

## Advanced Structures

Even with minimal syntax, you can build multi-layered documents. For instance:

### Detailed List Example

* **Overview:** Introduction to Gemtext's simplicity.
 * **Sub-item A:** Headings structure.
 * **Sub-item B:** List capabilities.
 * **Sub-item C:** Block quotes.
* **Security:** Gemini mandates TLS for privacy.
* **Limitations:** No inline formatting, images, or scripts.

### Multiple Link References

### Combining Elements

Below is an example combining headings, lists, quotes, and preformatted text:

# Combined Example

This section uses multiple Gemtext elements in one block.
 • Point One
 • Point Two
 • Nested lists are not supported; use multiple items.
